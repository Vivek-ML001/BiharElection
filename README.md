# 🗳️ Bihar Assembly Election ML Model

This project uses machine learning to analyze historical **Bihar Vidhan Sabha election data (2000–2020)** and predict whether a legislative race will be **tight or safe**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The aim is to assist political analysts, journalists, and data scientists by providing a predictive model that classifies election races based on:

- Voter turnout
- Party affiliation
- Constituency type (General/SC/ST)
- Margin and percentage of victory
- Total electors and votes polled
